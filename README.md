# Large Language Model-assisted text mining reveals bacterial pathogen diversity  

The study presents an automated, scalable pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to mine ∼24 million PubMed abstracts and systematically catalogue bacterial species reported to infect humans. By combining keyword filtering, zero‑shot LLM prompts to confirm causation, and synonym consolidation, the authors identified 1,222 putative pathogens, of which 783 species supported by ≥3 causative abstracts were deemed “confirmed.” They then extracted infection‑context details with 78 expert‑defined questions and high‑dimensional text embeddings, enabling trait mapping, body‑site specialism scoring, and unsupervised clustering into 75 ecologically coherent “pathogen types.” Publication‑rate analyses revealed accelerating recognition of new pathogens and highlighted emerging clusters such as zoonotic or antibiotic‑resistant species. The resulting open, updatable evidence base outperforms previous manual lists and offers a foundation for surveillance, diagnostics, and predictive modelling, illustrating how AI‑assisted literature synthesis can transform our understanding of microbial diversity and its impact on human health.
